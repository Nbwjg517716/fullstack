# Full Stack CRUD Application

## Overview
This project is a full stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application developed to demonstrate a complete implementation using modern technologies. The back-end is built with **Spring Boot** in Java, while the front-end leverages **React** and **JavaScript** for a seamless user interface.

---

## Features
- Full CRUD operations:
  - **Create:** Add new records to the database.
  - **Read:** View and retrieve existing records.
  - **Update:** Modify existing records.
  - **Delete:** Remove records from the database.
- Responsive and interactive UI built with React.
- RESTful APIs for efficient communication between the front-end and back-end.
- Robust error handling and validation.

---

## Technologies Used
### Back-End
- **Java**
- **Spring Boot**:
  - Spring Data JPA (for database interaction)
  - Spring Web (for RESTful APIs)
  - Spring Validation (for input validation)
- **H2 Database** (or replace with your choice of database)

### Front-End
- **React** (with Hooks and functional components)
- **JavaScript**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**

---

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
- **Node.js** and **npm**
- **Maven** (for managing Spring Boot dependencies)

### Back-End
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>/backend
   ```
2. Build and run the Spring Boot application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
3. The back-end server will be available at: `http://localhost:8080`

### Front-End
1. Navigate to the front-end directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-folder>/frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. The front-end application will be available at: `http://localhost:3000`

---

## API Endpoints
The back-end exposes the following RESTful API endpoints:

### Example Endpoints:
- `GET /api/items` - Retrieve all records.
- `POST /api/items` - Create a new record.
- `PUT /api/items/{id}` - Update a specific record.
- `DELETE /api/items/{id}` - Delete a specific record.

---

## Screenshots
(Add screenshots of the application here, showcasing the UI and functionality.)

---

## Future Improvements
- Enhance UI design with advanced styling.
- Implement user authentication and authorization.
- Integrate a more robust database system (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL).
- Add unit and integration tests.
